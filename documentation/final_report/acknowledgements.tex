I wish to thank my project supervisor, Dr. Fr\'{e}d\'{e}ric Labrosse for all of the guidance and vast amount of patience he provided throughout the duration of the project. Many of the ideas discussed within this report were originally suggested by Fred, before being developed further through a combined effort.

I also wish to thank all of my family for their continued support during my academic studies, and in particular thank you to my partner Sioned who without all the support she has given, I would never have been able to achieve all that I have till now.
