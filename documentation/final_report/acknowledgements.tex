I wish to thank my project supervisor, Dr. Fr\'{e}d\'{e}ric Labrosse for all of his guidance and vast levels of patience provided throughout the project. I also wish to thank all of my family for their continued support during my academic studies, and a particular thank you to my partner Sioned, who without I would simply would not have achieved what I currently have.
