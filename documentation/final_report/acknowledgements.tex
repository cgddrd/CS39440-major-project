I wish to thank my project supervisor, Dr. Fr\'{e}d\'{e}ric Labrosse for all of his guidance and vast levels of patience he gave in spades throughout the duration of the project. Many of the ideas presented in this paper were originally suggested by Fred, before being developed further through a combined effort. 

I also wish to thank all of my family for their continued support during my academic studies, and a particular thank you to my partner Sioned, who without I certainly would not have achieved all that I have to this point.
